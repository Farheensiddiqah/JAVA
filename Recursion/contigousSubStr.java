/*  Question4:We are given a string S,we need to find the 
count of all contiguous substrings starting and ending with 
the same character.
Sample Input 1: S = "abcab"    Sample Output 1: 7
There are 15 substrings of "abcab" :
 a, ab, abc, abca, abcab, b, bc, bca, bcab, c, ca, cab, a, ab, b
 Out of the above substrings,there are 7 substrings:
 a,abca,b,bcab,c,a and b.
 So,only 7 contiguous substrings start and end with the same character.
 
 Sample Input 2: S = "aba" Sample Output 2: 4
 The substrings are a, b, a and aba. */

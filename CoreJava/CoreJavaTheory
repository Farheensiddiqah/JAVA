OOPS
=====
Methodology to develop and design the programs using class and object

Advs of OOPS
-----------
1. Modularity
2. Reusability
3. Flexibility

Features in OOPS
---------------
1. class
2. object
3.Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphisim

class
======
class is a model/template/blueprint/prototype for creating objects.
egg= A thing is made twice before implementing once in our brain(known as class) and other as object

-> A class is a logical entity

characteristics
-----------------
1. Identification (Name of the object)
2.Properties (Variable)
3.Behaviour (Functions/Methods)

Example of Class
---------------
class Student{

}
How to create an object
------------------------
Student s1 = new Student();

 * What is DP?
 * ==========
 * DP is optimized recursion
 * 
 * How to identify DP?
 * 1. Optimal Problem
 * (to find min,max,smallest,largest,)
 * 2.Some choices is given (multiple branches in recursion tree)
 * eg:like recursion tree of fibnacci choices
 * 
 * Definition
 * ==========
 * Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that
 * helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have 
 * overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property.
 * 
 * Ways of DP
 * =========
 * 1. Memorization
 * ==================
 * -> Top down approach
 * i) Recursion
 * ii)subproblems-->storage-> reuse
 * 
 * 2.Tabulation
 * ===============
 * --> Bottom Up approach
 * --> More efficient
 * --> Using tables

Tabulation Approach
-------------------
1.Create table and initialize(with base case)
2. Understand meaning for index
3. fill up from (small to large)
 
7 important questions
=====================
1.Fibonacci
2.0-1 Kanpsack
3.Unbounded Kanpsack
4.LCS (Longest Common Subsequences)
5. Kadanes Algorithm (Array)
6. Catlan Number
7. DP on Grid(2D Arrays)

ii)0-1 Kanpsack
----------------
1. Subset Sum
2.Equal Subset sum paritions

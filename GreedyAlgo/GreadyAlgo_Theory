Defination
==============

Greedy algorithm is the problem solving technique where wheremake 
the locally optimum choice at each stage & hope to achieve a globally
optimum.

-> In other word we can say that rather than exploring all the possible ways
 we can just explore one best ways

-> One example is that to hire a candidate
there are many rounds like online test--(1)--(1000) write
                        Interview -------(2 round)------shortlist(100)
                        hr-------------(3 round)-----shortlist(20)
                        and hire finally 10

Approch
=======
1. mostly they ask for optimization--(min to find or max)
2.Mostly we also apply sorting first
3. and dont have any fixed rule or approch like merge sort example

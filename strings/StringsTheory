Strings are immutable

in input - if we give name=sc.next();
and input as : Farheen Siddiqah
 then output as: Farheen

if we want both Farheen Siddiqah then while Scanning use 
String name;
name = sc.nextLine();

for finding length
===================
//Includes spaces also and the difference is include () for string


StringBuilder
==============
here since strings are immutable we cannot modify so in this case we can use string builder
Syntax:  StringBuilder sb= new StringBuilder(" ");
